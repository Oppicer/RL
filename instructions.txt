# Getting Started with the RTX 3070 Code-Creation Agent

This guide helps you set up and run the training pipeline on a single RTX 3070 with 8 GB of VRAM. No prior experience is required.

## 1. Install Python and Create the Environment

1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if you do not already have it.
2. Open a terminal and create a new environment:

```bash
conda create -n q3070 python=3.10 -y
conda activate q3070
```

3. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install "unsloth[flash-attn]" transformers accelerate bitsandbytes peft \
            datasets tiktoken wandb triton==2.1.0 ray==2.11.0 vllm==0.4.0
```

## 2. Prepare the Dataset

The repository provides a script that downloads a small sample of The Stack dataset and tokenizes it. If the dataset is gated, run `huggingface-cli login` to authenticate with the Hugging Face Hub first.

```bash
bash data/build_dataset.sh
```

The processed data will be stored in the `dataset/` directory (about 20 MB). You can override this location by setting the `DATASET_DIR` environment variable before running the script.

## 3. Download Base Model Weights (4-bit)

Use the helper script to download the base model in 4-bit form:

```bash
python scripts/pull_4bit.py
```

This creates the `models/4bit/` directory with the model and tokenizer.

## 4. Run the Training Pipeline

Launch the simplified training pipeline, which performs supervised fine-tuning and shows where later stages would go:

```bash
python pipelines/train_full.py --config configs/rtx3070.yaml
```

Training outputs are saved under `outputs/`.

## 5. Launch the Gradio Interface

After training, you can test the model with the Gradio web UI:

```bash
python gui/gradio_app.py
```

A local web server will open in your browser where you can submit prompts.

## 6. Run Benchmark Evaluations

Use the helper script in `eval/` to evaluate a checkpoint on HumanEval and a
small APPS subset. Provide the path to your model and choose the benchmark
subset:

```bash
python eval/run_all.py --ckpt <path-to-checkpoint> --subset humaneval,apps_dev_med
```

Results are written under the `eval_results/` directory by default.

## Troubleshooting

- **Out of Memory (OOM)**: reduce the `batch_size` or sequence length in `configs/rtx3070.yaml`.
- **Slow training**: remove `gradient_checkpointing` or lower LoRA ranks.
- **Dataset script fails**: ensure you have an internet connection when downloading datasets.

For additional details, see `README.md`.
